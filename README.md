My name is Andre Butler and I'm currently focused on developing web-based software. I was born and raised in Wichita, KS! After graduating college at Fort Hays State University, I spent several years traveling the United States as a Hospitality Sales Professional for a hotel start-up based in my hometown, Wichita. Throughout my travels across the country, I was fortunate to improve my interpersonal skills, and ultimately gain exposure to coding in the travel industry. I absolutely loved how coding was able to automate my sales processes which inspired me to complete my first Web Developer Bootcamp, look deeper into the work I do professionally, and to be purpose driven in my next career. 

I am also Developer who is passionate about creating technology to elevate people, build community, and inspire more civic engagement! My recent projects include Chatbot using an API to locate cuisine by a user’s location and a site that displays intersections in Oklahoma City, proper that are the most accident prone.
